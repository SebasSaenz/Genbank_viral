However, our knowledge of them is quite limited. There\nare currently **27321** phage genomes in the NCBI and this number will continue to grow as researchers produce sequencing data. **This website provides an overview of the number of [phages and jumbo phages](jumbophages.html), [size](genome_size.html), [molecule type](type_molecule.html) and [host](host.html) of bacteriophage genomes stored in the NCBI.**\n\n## Data source\n\nThe website uses the monthly dataset published by [INPHARED](https://github.com/RyanCook94/inphared). I used the `DateMonthYear_data.tsv`, to create all the plots and calculate the number of phages in the database. If you use this dataset, please have a look at their [publication](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/phage.2021.0007).\n\n\n\n## Updates\nAt the moment the website is updated manually every month and depends on the [INPHARED](https://github.com/RyanCook94/inphared) dataset. I hope to be able to automate this process in the next few months.\n\nLast update 2024-03-29\n\n:::",
